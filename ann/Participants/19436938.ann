T1	Participants 50 88	older sarcopenic obese New Zealanders.

T4	Participants 567 758	One hundred eighty-three older adults (age 72.7 +/- 6 years, range 56-93; body mass index 28.2 +/- 4.9, range 16.6-46.0) were recruited from a New Zealand falls prevention intervention trial.
T5	Participants 759 1038	Total and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), percent fat, and bone mineralization were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and used to characterize normal lean (NL, n = 51), sarcopenic (SS, n = 18), sarcopenic obese (SO, n = 29), and obese (OO, n = 85) phenotypes.
T6	Participants 1615 1629	low ASM groups
