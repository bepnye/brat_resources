T1	Participants 0 154	Polymorphisms of ADORA2A modulate psychomotor vigilance and the effects of caffeine on neurobehavioural performance and sleep EEG after sleep deprivation.
T2	Participants 825 929	A haplotype analysis of eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ADORA2A was performed in 82 volunteers.
T3	Participants 930 1155	In 45 young men carrying five different allele combinations, we investigated the effects of prolonged waking and 2 × 200 mg caffeine or 2 × 100 mg modafinil on psychomotor vigilance, sleepiness, and the waking and sleep EEG
