T1	Participants 482 576	Thirty nonbleeding patients with international normalized ratios (INRs) ranging from 6.0-10.0.
T2	Participants 591 687	Patients were randomized to receive either a single oral dose of phytonadione 2.5 mg or placebo.
T3	Participants 1515 1559	asymptomatic patients with INRs of 6.0-10.0.
T4	Participants 1606 1759	patients at high risk for bleeding in whom the benefit of prompt INR reduction would outweigh the thromboembolic risk associated with INR overcorrection.
