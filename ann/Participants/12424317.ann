T1	Participants 0 23	Global contour saliency
T2	Participants 58 190	Our visual system can link components of contours and segregate contours from complex backgrounds based on geometric grouping rules.
T3	Participants 191 252	This is an important intermediate step in object recognition.
T4	Participants 253 403	The substrate for contour integration may be based on contextual interactions and intrinsic horizontal connections seen in primary visual cortex (V1).
T5	Participants 404 590	We examined the perceptual rules governing contour saliency to determine whether the spatial extents of contextual interactions and horizontal connections match those mediating saliency.
T6	Participants 591 691	To quantify these rules, we used stimuli composed of randomly oriented nonoverlapping line segments.
T7	Participants 692 793	Salient contours within this complex background were formed by colinear alignment of nearby segments.
T8	Participants 794 869	Contour detectability was measured using a 2-interval-forced-choice design.
