T7	Treatment 526 611	ELT was carried out using a XeCl Excimer Laser with an emission wavelength of 308 nm.
T8	Treatment 612 723	Eight spots were equally distributed at a distance of 500 microm from one another over the anterior trabeculum.
T9	Treatment 746 850	treated with a frequency-doubled q-switched neodymium:yytrium-aluminum-garnet laser (wavelength 532 nm).
