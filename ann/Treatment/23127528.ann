T1	Treatment 455 560	Monitoring of serum TMs and computed tomography were performed every 4 weeks until progression of disease
T2	Treatment 656 812	we analyzed the fluctuation rates of TMs with high pretreatment positive rates, and defined the criteria of progressive disease under TM monitoring (TM-PD).
T3	Treatment 854 983	we calculated the time to progression (TTP) under this TM-PD criteria, which was compared with the TTP under the RECIST criteria.
