T1	HMM 992 1096	Lorazepam increased direction errors in the antisaccade and no-saccade tasks in a dose-dependent manner.
T2	HMM 1097 1140	Sertraline had no effect on these measures.
T3	HMM 1141 1271	Correlation showed a statistically significant, but rather weak, association between direction errors and smooth pursuit measures.
T4	HMM 1272 1349	Practice was shown to have a powerful effect on antisaccade direction errors.
T5	HMM 1407 1538	lorazepam reliably worsens saccadic distractibility, in contrast to other psychotropic drugs such as sertraline and chlorpromazine.
T6	HMM 1543 1687	results also suggest that other studies in this field, particularly those using parallel groups design, should take account of practice effects.
