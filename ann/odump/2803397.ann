T1	HMM 842 904	plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucose, lactate
T2	HMM 1242 1394	Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia (Groups 1-3).
T3	HMM 1395 1527	Plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) increased significantly in Group 4 (retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia).
T4	HMM 1528 1588	There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR.
T5	HMM 1589 1750	The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose, lactate and free glycerol.
