T1	HMM 873 1109	No significant difference was observed after 6 and 12 months of treatment in PEF variability, FEV1 or bronchial hyperreactivity in the NS group compared with baseline values, while a significant difference was observed in symptom score.
T2	HMM 1110 1237	BDP group showed a significant improvement in FEV1 and bronchial reactivity to methacholine after 6 and 12 months of treatment.
T3	HMM 1238 1348	In the BDP + S group, the improvement in symptoms and pulmonary function persisted until the end of the study.
T4	HMM 1364 1596	the combination of beclomethasone dipropionate and salmeterol improved pulmonary function and bronchial reactivity earlier than beclomethasone dipropionate alone, while nedocromil sodium improved symptoms but not pulmonary function.
T5	HMM 1611 1631	bronchial reactivity
T6	HMM 1689 1883	overtreatment of asthma in relationship with the classification of asthma severity of the International Guidelines could improve both airway inflammation and the prognosis of airway obstruction.
