T1	HMM 1536 1559	child social competence
T2	HMM 1632 1673	children's positive and negative behavior
T3	HMM 1730 1921	Results indicated that program participation had a moderate treatment effect (d = .55) on social competence (p = .02) that was independent of pretest levels, age, gender, and referral status.
T4	HMM 1922 2124	Results showed that higher levels of program attendance predicted children's trajectories of observed positive (β = .500; p = .003) and negative behavior (β = -.062; p < .001) over the 11-week program
