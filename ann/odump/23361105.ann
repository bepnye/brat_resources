T1	HMM 41 98	fibrinolysis, inflammation, and blood product transfusion
T2	HMM 232 325	release of nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)
T3	HMM 438 603	fibrinolytic and inflammatory response to CPB and that bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism reduces fibrinolysis, inflammation, and subsequent transfusion requirements.

T5	HMM 855 882	decreased D-dimer formation
T6	HMM 897 928	decrease postoperative bleeding
T7	HMM 956 1009	decreased fibrinolysis and EACA attenuated blood loss
T8	HMM 1140 1158	to t-PA generation
T9	HMM 1215 1236	on plasmin generation
T10	HMM 1248 1283	to decreased D-dimer concentrations
