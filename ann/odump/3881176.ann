T1	HMM 469 478	tolerated
T2	HMM 495 522	levels of myelosuppression.
T3	HMM 527 558	objective partial response rate
T4	HMM 589 612	Objective stabilization
T5	HMM 721 769	subjective response rate (partial plus complete)
T6	HMM 893 907	response rates
T7	HMM 920 929	survival.
T8	HMM 939 1125	there was no significant difference in survival between the two arms, reflecting the similarity between DC and CF in total objective response rate (partial response plus stable disease).
