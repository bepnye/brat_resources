T1	HMM 1345 1427	parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not to targets;
T2	HMM 1437 1539	amplitude and latency to targets increased for the frontal P50 while decreasing to non-target stimuli.
T3	HMM 1559 1615	minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli
T4	HMM 1620 1660	increased responses to relevant stimuli.
T5	HMM 1718 1774	better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses
T6	HMM 1859 2046	significant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centro-parietal, and parieto-occipital regions of interest in response to target and distracter stimuli
