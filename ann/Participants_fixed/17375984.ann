T0	Participants 96 229	healthy subjects and asymptomatic carriers of the acute intermittent porphyria gene who have increased porphyrin precursor excretion.
T1	Participants 1388 1555	healthy subjects and asymptomatic porphobilinogen deaminase-deficient subjects with high concentrations of porphobilinogen, the substrate of porphobilinogen deaminase.
T2	Participants 1569 1807	Forty individuals participated in this two-part study: 20 asymptomatic porphobilinogen deaminase-deficient subjects (both male and female) with > or =4 times the upper reference urinary porphobilinogen level, and 20 healthy male subjects.
T3	Participants 1925 2072	Part A included 12 asymptomatic porphobilinogen deaminase-deficient subjects, and the enzyme was administered in an open-label, single-dose design.
T4	Participants 2073 2174	Part B included 20 asymptomatic porphobilinogen deaminase-deficient subjects and 20 healthy subjects.
