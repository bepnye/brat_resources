T1	Participants 251 267	elderly patients
T2	Participants 466 483	elderly patients.
T3	Participants 518 614	160 patients aged more than 70 years scheduled to undergo isolated myocardial revascularization.

T5	Participants 824 990	80 patients undergoing standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery (left internal thoracic artery on left anterior descending coronary artery plus saphenous veins).
T6	Participants 1063 1557	Preoperative characteristics and risk factors (EuroSCORE: group 1 = 7.9 vs group 2 = 8.1), number of grafted coronary vessels (group 1 = 2.4 vs group 2 = 2.5), aortic crossclamping time (group 1 = 37 +/- 7 minutes vs group 2 = 38 +/- 7 minutes), ventilation time (group 1 = 22 +/- 12 hours vs group 2 = 23 +/- 11 hours), intensive care unit stay (group 1 = 39 +/- 10 hours vs group 2 = 40 +/- 9 hours), and hospital mortality (group 1 = 3.8% vs group 2 = 5%) were comparable between the groups.
