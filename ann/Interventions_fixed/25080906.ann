T0	Interventions 11 69	zero-balanced ultrafiltration and modified ultrafiltration
T1	Interventions 176 234	zero-balanced ultrafiltration and modified ultrafiltration
T2	Interventions 369 554	3 groups: a zero-balanced ultrafiltration group (Z group), a modified ultrafiltration group (M group) and a zero-balanced ultrafiltration with modified ultrafiltration group (Z+M group)
T3	Interventions 556 877	Oxygenation index (OI), difference of alveoli-arterial oxygen pressure (P(A-Î±)O2), static lung compliance (Cstat), and airway resistance (Raw) were measured before caridopulmonary bypass (CPB, T1), 20 minutes after the CPB (T2), 2 h after the operation (T3), 6 h after the operation (T4) and 12 h after the operation (T5)
T4	Interventions 1409 1478	CONCLUSION Zero-balanced ultrafiltration and modified ultrafiltration
