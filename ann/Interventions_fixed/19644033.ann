T1	Interventions 169 191	isometric contractions
T2	Interventions 196 261	passive stretching on muscle-tendon mechanics and muscle activity
T3	Interventions 314 621	peak concentric and passive ankle joint moment data were recorded on an isokinetic dynamometer with electromyographic monitoring of the triceps surae; real-time motion analysis of the lower leg and ultrasound imaging of the Achilles-medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon junction were simultaneously conducted.
T4	Interventions 653 757	six 8-s maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) before repeating the passive and active trials.
T5	Interventions 1215 1246	static plantar flexor stretches
