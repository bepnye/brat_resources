T6	Outcomes 613 653	quantified the area of embolic particles
T7	Outcomes 699 741	embolic phenomena (zero, moderate, severe)
T8	Outcomes 879 951	Manual grading of emboli correlated highly with software quantification.
T9	Outcomes 973 1151	presence and similarity of emboli generation with both methods of intramedullary nailing. Unreamed nails do not protect the patient from pulmonary embolization of marrow contents
