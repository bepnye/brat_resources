T1	Outcomes 909 1059	Outcome was favourable, with no seizures and mildly affected cognitive functions. Interictal EEG showed short sequences of irregular 3-Hz spike-waves.
T2	Outcomes 1080 1117	clinical characteristics were similar
T3	Outcomes 1174 1255	exhibited myoclonic status and vibratory tonic seizures, with persisting seizures
T4	Outcomes 1270 1342	EEG showed long sequences of generalised irregular spike and slow waves.
T5	Outcomes 1530 1623	atypical absences, tonic and partial seizures, and no myoclonus, or vibratory tonic seizures.
T6	Outcomes 1632 1675	mental retardation and persisting seizures.
T7	Outcomes 1687 1781	long sequences of slow spike-wave activity and half the patients had spike and slow wave foci.
T8	Outcomes 1830 1854	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
T9	Outcomes 2085 2120	risk factors for mental retardation
T10	Outcomes 2335 2346	distinction
