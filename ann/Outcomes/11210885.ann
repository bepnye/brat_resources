T1	Outcomes 93 118	improve the voice quality
T2	Outcomes 229 327	pneumatic artificial source of voice incorporated in a regular tracheoesophageal (TE) shunt valve.
T3	Outcomes 706 905	speech rate, maximal phonation time, perceptual voice evaluation of read-aloud prose by an expert listener, speech intelligibility measurements with 12 listeners, and self-assessment by the patients.
T4	Outcomes 916 974	extensive acoustical and aerodynamic in vivo registrations
T5	Outcomes 997 1037	newly developed data acquisition system.
T6	Outcomes 1190 1369	improves voice quality and increases the average pitch of voice, without decreasing intelligibility or necessitating other pressure and airflow rates than regular TE shunt speech.
T7	Outcomes 1370 1386	Pitch regulation
T8	Outcomes 1467 1475	feasible
