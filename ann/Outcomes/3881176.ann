T1	Outcomes 469 478	tolerated
T2	Outcomes 495 522	levels of myelosuppression.
T3	Outcomes 527 558	objective partial response rate
T4	Outcomes 589 612	Objective stabilization
T5	Outcomes 721 769	subjective response rate (partial plus complete)
T6	Outcomes 893 907	response rates
T7	Outcomes 920 929	survival.
T8	Outcomes 939 1125	there was no significant difference in survival between the two arms, reflecting the similarity between DC and CF in total objective response rate (partial response plus stable disease).
T9	Outcomes 1147 1157	palliation
T10	Outcomes 1171 1180	tolerated
