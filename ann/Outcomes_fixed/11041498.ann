T0	Outcomes 1321 1471	All 5 horses showed radiographic evidence of bony fusion, however, no fusion was present when injected joints were examined on postmortem examination.
T1	Outcomes 1472 1596	Histologic examination revealed thinning of the cartilage, diffuse necrosis of chondrocytes, with the calcified zone intact.
T2	Outcomes 1597 1674	Subjectively, exercise did not influence the degree of cartilage destruction.
T3	Outcomes 1675 1817	Based on this study, chemical arthrodesis cannot be advocated in clinical cases because of the high complication rate and lack of bony fusion.
