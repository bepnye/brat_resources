T0	Outcomes 838 1012	Following resistance exercise, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was reduced to a greater extent in the CHO treatment (-48 +/- 7%) than in the CHO+PRO treatment (-15 +/- 14%, P < 0.01).
T1	Outcomes 1013 1150	During recovery, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation increased in both experiments (P < 0.01), and tended to be higher in the CHO+PRO test (P = 0.08).
T2	Outcomes 1151 1309	S6K1 phosphorylation at T(421)/S(424) substantially increased following exercise and remained elevated during recovery with no differences between treatments.
T3	Outcomes 1310 1470	In contrast to the CHO treatment (-4 +/- 2%), S6K1 phosphorylation at T(389) was higher following exercise in the CHO+PRO treatment only (+78 +/- 2%, P < 0.01).
T4	Outcomes 1471 1569	During recovery, S6K1 phosphorylation at T(389) remained higher in CHO+PRO than in CHO (P < 0.05).
T5	Outcomes 1570 1766	S6 phosphorylation was substantially higher following exercise in the CHO+PRO (1.69 +/- 0.35) than in the CHO experiment (0.45 +/- 0.07, P < 0.01) and remained elevated during recovery (P < 0.05).
