T0	Outcomes 817 1046	No significant decrease in total respiratory resistance at 8 Hz (Rrs [8]) was observed after ipratropium, whereas Rrs (8) decreased significantly 20 min after fenoterol and 40 min after the combination regimen (p less than 0.05).
T1	Outcomes 1047 1177	All three studied drugs resulted in a significant increase in the reactance (p less than 0.01) and decrease in resonant frequency.
T2	Outcomes 1178 1428	Both fenoterol (delta FEV1 34 percent, p less than 0.0001) and the combination regimen (delta FEV1 38 percent, p less than 0.0001) resulted in a significantly larger increase in FEV1 than ipratropium alone (delta FEV1 17 percent, p less than 0.0001).
T3	Outcomes 1429 1571	A second dose of fenoterol and of the combination regimen resulted in a further significant increase in FEV1 after 120 min (p less than 0.05).
T4	Outcomes 1572 1658	A second dose of ipratropium did not result in a further significant increase in FEV1.
T5	Outcomes 1663 1848	changes in respiratory impedance were qualitatively similar for all three drug regimens, but larger in absolute terms after fenoterol and the combination regimen than after ipratropium.
T6	Outcomes 1849 2107	The similar effect of these drugs on the reactance can be explained by an increase in the capacitance of the respiratory system, and in combination with a decrease in frequency dependence of resistance, by assuming a decrease in peripheral airway resistance.
