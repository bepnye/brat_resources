T0	Outcomes 894 986	Between-group comparisons revealed no significant differences in clinical outcome variables.
T1	Outcomes 987 1138	Only a subgroup of patients with pronounced negative symptoms developed some clinical improvement as indicated by significant changes in the GAF-scale.
T2	Outcomes 1147 1284	there is some evidence for a more favourable clinical outcome within this subgroup after rTMS in the CGI-S and PANSS negative scale, too.
T3	Outcomes 1326 1463	results suggest a moderate - potentially clinically relevant - treatment effect of prefrontal 10 Hz rTMS stimulation in chronic patients.
