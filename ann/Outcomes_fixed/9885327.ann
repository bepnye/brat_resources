T0	Outcomes 1100 1201	CM was also significantly superior to EC during the first attack for complete headache relief (20 vs.
T1	Outcomes 1202 1232	8%, p = 0.006), nausea (42 vs.
T2	Outcomes 1233 1244	63%, p = 0.
T3	Outcomes 1245 1296	007) and willingness to take the drug again (90 vs.
T4	Outcomes 1297 1313	80%, p = 0.043).
T5	Outcomes 1314 1491	The global efficacy evaluation, rated by the investigators, was significantly more favorable to CM for both attacks (p = 0.001 for the first attack and p = 0.02 for the second).
T6	Outcomes 1492 1566	The patients' evaluation was significant for the first attack (p = 0.002).
T7	Outcomes 1567 1660	The global incidence of adverse events was 45% higher with EC, though not significant (32 vs.
T8	Outcomes 1661 1677	22%, p = 0.075).
T9	Outcomes 1678 1744	They were most often unspecific and mild to moderate in intensity.
T10	Outcomes 1745 1830	Gastrointestinal side effects were significantly less frequent with CM than EC (7 vs.
T11	Outcomes 1831 1847	21%, p = 0.001).
T12	Outcomes 1848 1967	Thus, CM is more effective and has a better gastrointestinal safety than EC in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.
