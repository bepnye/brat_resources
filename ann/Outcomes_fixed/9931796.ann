T0	Outcomes 321 515	Lethality was 56% in the sepsis group; in the therapy group lethality was significantly lower in patients with plasmapheresis, even though in this population the organic failure rate was higher.
T1	Outcomes 524 587	the dependency of lethality and age was similar in both groups.
T2	Outcomes 588 711	Lethality at 22% in the plasmapheresis group with double organ failure was significantly lower (P > 0.01) than in controls.
T3	Outcomes 712 856	Reduction of lethality seemed to be as high as 18% in patients with sepsis, while patients with SIRS did not profit from the additional therapy.
