T0	Outcomes 467 587	Acute glucose infusion resulted in maternal hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and an increase in the blood lactate level.
T1	Outcomes 588 670	Cord blood glucose, insulin, and lactate levels were also increased in this group.
T2	Outcomes 671 905	The key finding of this study was the significant lowering of pH in the umbilical cord vein (7.31 +/- 0.04) and artery (7.21 +/- 0.06) in the glucose-infused group when compared with the non-glucose infusion groups (p less than 0.05).
T3	Outcomes 906 1060	Confounding perinatal factors such as maternal position, maternal hypotension, and prolonged time of surgery did not influence the fetal acid-base status.
T4	Outcomes 1061 1194	Thus acute maternal glucose infusion in normal patients can cause fetal hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and neonatal hypoglycemia.
T5	Outcomes 1195 1323	These findings may be of particular clinical importance when fetal distress or fetal hypoxemia is due to other perinatal events.
T6	Outcomes 1324 1434	Under these circumstances, acute maternal glucose infusion may further contribute to fetal metabolic acidosis.
