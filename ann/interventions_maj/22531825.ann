T1	Intervention 28 69	haptic decomposition of complex movements
T2	Intervention 78 107	robot-assisted motor learning
T3	Intervention 110 139	Training with haptic guidance
T4	Intervention 422 464	haptic feedback from a robotic exoskeleton
T5	Intervention 701 1041	elbow flexion/extension and the unified shoulder motion independently ("anatomical" decomposition), 2) three component shoulder motions in Euler coordinates and elbow flexion/extension ("Euler" decomposition), or 3) the motion of the tip of the elbow and motion of the hand with respect to the elbow, independently ("visual" decomposition).
T6	Intervention 1087 1137	movements, but experienced the target motion only,
T7	Intervention 1406 1444	simpler, anatomically-isolated motions
