T7	Intervention 526 611	ELT was carried out using a XeCl Excimer Laser with an emission wavelength of 308 nm.
T8	Intervention 612 723	Eight spots were equally distributed at a distance of 500 microm from one another over the anterior trabeculum.
T9	Intervention 746 850	treated with a frequency-doubled q-switched neodymium:yytrium-aluminum-garnet laser (wavelength 532 nm).
T10	Intervention 851 1032	Approximately 50 adjacent, but not overlapping, laser spots were distributed over 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork, using an energy level ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mJ per pulse.
